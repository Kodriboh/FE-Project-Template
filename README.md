# FE-Project-Template

Project template for quickly setting up a project with Grunt, SASS, and JS.

## To Use
Clone the repository and install the dependencies: <code>yarn install</code>

You may then run <code>grunt watch</code> to compile your scss. compiled css is minified and stored within the docs (public) folder. This folder is named as such to allow compatibility with Github pages. For deployment only the minified css is necessary.

This project is set up to use the 7-1 pattern with Sass.
